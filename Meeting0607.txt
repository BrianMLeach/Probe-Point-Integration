Embedded cover options

Buffered not realtime. Because there is no output path while we are running

Instrument blocks for statement coverage. Because it uses less code and RAM space.

Instrument using macros in c_cover.h

Because instrumentation is inline in the UUT, not a function call to c_cover_io, therefore
faster and should be smaller, but check the linker map.

License probe points. Goes to Stuart. Sorted.

MCDC macro or function call

Basis path is a topic for unit testing, but can have a mini lab. But MCDC

Cover bytes used it is out of date. Craig.

Look for inline functions.

vcdb2vcm with instrument none. Intended behaviour for c_cover_io.c.

GUI indication that a UUT is instrumented for probe points.

Clicast Cover instrument probe point

Before apply the probe point is not in the source file (not instrumented)

The Remove all is not sufficient, because we want to remove some but not all.

vcdb2vcm. Is there instrument for probe point?

After a DIIP and delta to UUT and EIIP are the pps re-applied when manage reinstruments.
What cli is needed to trigger this?

Autotool to enable / disable probe points. Adding/Removing code.
Enable / disable probe points at run time.

Total instrumented PPs is 1000, but not much more.

__PPID__. Allows us to get the probe point ID in the function. In our case it is used as
the first parameter to the VCAST_PP_SaveFuncParms.

Read probe points from XML.

Header collapse. None is good.

VCAST_PP_SaveFuncParms(i, a, b, c)

Does multi put zeroes in array. Yes.

Does Simon's code behave if there is a store to a disabled PPSave. Yes.

Is there a MCDC problem in IoHwAbstr?

Is there a probe point ID problem?

IoHwAbsrSetDiscrete() called

FFDD8004. Counter periodicity works.
