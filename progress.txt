Filelist.txt (only one file).

Make of source needs to be a clean make.
Intermediate files must be writable.

This is OK.


Probe points in menu bar not accessible.

FB 59063. Click outside the source file item and select it again. The probe point tool bar control
will be enabled. This is a recent issue and should be fixed soon.


Coverage files needed.
----------------------

I don't think it is a good idea to rely on files in the environment directory. VC has commands for
dealing with this.

To export coverage.

Coverage -> Export script -> All results.

To import coverage.

Coverage -> Delete imported results.
Coverage -> Import script

This cannot be easily carried out on the command line because Delete imported results is not implemented.

WARNING: Source files are checksummed before instrumentation. The source must stay the same for these
commands to work correctly.

Coverage scenario.
------------------

Each tester has an environment with exactly the same source files as the master environment. They
accumulate coverage into their environment.
At some point their accumulated results are exported to the master environment. This may be carried
out more than once, but be careful about duplicated results. Although not harmful they do clutter the
reports.
Also recommend coverage test result names are unique across the whole test base. For example prepend
the testers initials to the test result name.
